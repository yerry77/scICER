# scICER: Consistent Clustering for scRNA-seq in R

### **scICER** is an R package for evaluating the **consistency of clustering** in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. It reimplements the **scICE** methodology, systematically assessing how stable cluster labels are across multiple stochastic runs. With seamless integration into **Seurat**, scICER can analyze cluster consistency on embeddings corrected by integration methods such as **Harmony** or **scVI**. Benchmarks across multiple datasets show that scICER reliably reproduces the original scICE results while being fully accessible in the R ecosystem. This makes it a practical tool for ensuring reproducible and consistent clustering in complex, multi-sample scRNA-seq studies.

## codes examples to run scICER 
### This folder contains example R scripts demonstrating the use of **scICER**, a tool for consistent clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data. The scripts include a basic usage example as well as two workflows showing how scICER can be combined with common integration methods (**Harmony** and **scVI**) for downstream analysis. Each script produces IC plots, ECS scores, and updates the Seurat object with optimal clusters. https://github.com/yerry77/scICER/tree/main/codes
