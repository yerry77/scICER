# scICER 
## codes examples to run scICER 
### This folder contains example R scripts demonstrating the use of **scICER**, a tool for consistent clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data. The scripts include a basic usage example as well as two workflows showing how scICER can be combined with common integration methods (**Harmony** and **scVI**) for downstream analysis. Each script produces IC plots, ECS scores, and updates the Seurat object with optimal clusters. https://github.com/yerry77/scICER/tree/main/codes
